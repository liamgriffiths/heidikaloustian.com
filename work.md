# Artist Statement

As a writer, I often come to my subject by salvaging or scavenging existing
narratives. I re-purpose, like found objects in collage, myths, canonical
texts, the history of art. Visual culture is a reoccurring subject of my
fiction. I have written on cabinets of curiosity (the medieval prototype of the
museum), spaces of collection, and the nature of looking.

Working at the intersection of literary and visual mediums, I am interested in
illuminated manuscripts and illustration, the object of the book and the
aesthetics of the page. Much of my work interrogates the dynamic between a
paired image and text. How does the image alter a text? What is lost when a
narrative is translated into a visual language? What is created?
