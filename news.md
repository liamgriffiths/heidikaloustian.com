This spring, I graduate from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop! I am excited to
continue work on my first novel as a 2015 Schulze Fellow in Memphis, TN.

Sadly, I’ll also be leaving my position as the Fiction Editor of The Iowa
Review. (Issues will continue to run until Spring 2016. Check them out at
http://iowareview.org/) It has been thrilling to discover new fiction, and work
with writers on their stories. In 2014, the magazine’s fiction received honors
like a Tim McGinnis Award and Pushcart Nomination. Recent issues have featured
work by some of my heroes, like David Lynch and Tatyana Tolstaya (The Slynx).
It was an amazing two years, and I’m so grateful to the editorial team at the
Iowa Review.

Check back soon for upcoming visual work. A new series of micro-collages are
coming in the fall, called Locket World.

My fellowship year has come to an end!

I am so grateful for the generous support of the Kresge Foundation, ArtServe
Michigan, and Midtown Detroit Inc.

In the fall, I begin graduate study at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, as an MFA
candidate in Fiction. I will also serve as the Fiction Editor of the Iowa
Review, a tri-annual literary journal. Be sure to subscribe!

In the meantime, my work will be featured in the exhibition “On the Road:
Detroit” from July 11th-13th, at the Jam Handy. Organized and curated by the
Los Angeles-based publication, the Art Book Review.

Look for the illustrated booklet and letterpress suite of my short story, “A
Living”!

New work is coming in 2013.

I am excited to announce that I will be a featured artist in the 2013 ART X
Detroit.

I have been commissioned by Midtown Detroit, Inc. to turn my short story “A
Living” into an illuminated manuscript. I’ll be working in collaboration with
the letterpress studio Salt and Cedar and visual artists Achille Bianchi and
Jon Sandberg on a series of twelve pieces and a limited edition book.

The series will be on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit from
April 10th-28th.
